!Still working on this!

This project demonstrates how to interact with APIs that use OAuth 2.0 authentication, with a focus on the Strava API.

Building this app helped me apply and deepen my understanding of:

Making HTTP requests in Python using the requests library, including sending data and handling responses.

Implementing OAuth 2.0 authorization flows securely.

Handling API errors gracefully using try-except blocks with exceptions like ConnectionError and HTTPError.

Managing API tokens, including access and refresh tokens, to maintain authenticated sessions.

Using Flask to build a web interface that integrates with third-party APIs.
