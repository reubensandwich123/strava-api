Here’s your updated README section with a **✅ To-Do** list added at the end. I’ve also slightly polished the formatting for clarity and consistency:

---

# 🚴‍♂️ Strava OAuth 2.0 Demo App

✅ *Still in progress*: Currently working with Strava to enable **multi-athlete access** — at the moment, only the developer (me) can authenticate and retrieve data due to Strava’s *Single Player Mode*.

---

## 🌐 About the Project

This project demonstrates how to interact with APIs that use **OAuth 2.0** authentication, specifically with the **Strava API**. It showcases a working web application built with **Flask** that authorizes a user, retrieves their athlete data, and displays it.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 📡 Making HTTP Requests

Using the `requests` library to send data, set headers, and handle responses from web APIs.

### 🔐 Implementing OAuth 2.0 Authorization

Safely managing the flow of user authorization using **access** and **refresh tokens**.

### 🛠️ Error Handling with Try-Except Blocks

Gracefully catching exceptions like `ConnectionError` and `HTTPError` to improve user experience.

### 🔄 Managing API Tokens

Persisting and refreshing tokens to maintain authenticated sessions between user visits.

### 🌍 Building Flask Web Interfaces

Creating user-facing routes to connect, display, and interact with the Strava API.
